# 📊 Weekly Data Analysis Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of weekly data analysis projects completed as part of my learning journey in Python, Pandas, NumPy, and related libraries.  
Each week focuses on a different dataset and applies core data analysis concepts such as data cleaning, transformation, statistical analysis, and visualization.
